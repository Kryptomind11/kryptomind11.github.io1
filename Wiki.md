I played basketball since I was 12 years old. Since then it is a sport that has opened a lot of door for me and get into prestigeous schools like UW


## Section 1
My story all started when I move to the United State from cameroon when I was 14 years old. I went to a boarding school called The MacDuffie School

At the time I was not very good at the game, I struggled with coordination and understanding the game. Slowly but surely I got better and was able to build a name for myself.
I did two wonderful years there then I transferred to a another school called Westtown school where I did another two years.
